    "<p> The quality of generated random numbers is evaluated using generic statistical tests defined by security standards. \n",
    "They are thus used mostly offline.\n",
    "Several sets of statistical tests exist.\n",
    "Their objectives vary depending on the application targeted. \n",
    "In general, the precision of statistical test suites is tightly linked to the decisions threshold and the amount of input data they require. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common strategy in statistical testing is as follows: different statistical features of an ideal RNG are evaluated \n",
    "to be then compared with output values of a real RNG to check for a so-called null hypothesis.\n",
    "The null hypothesis is a statement of `no difference' between the tested generator and an ideal RNG.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The <i>FIPS 140-1 test suite</i> is the simplest set of tests aimed at testing random number generators in cryptographic modules. \n",
    "The following four tests included in the FIPS 140-1 test suite require 20000 bits as input:\n",
    "    <ol>\n",
    "        <li><i>Monobit test</i> -- tests the proportion of bits equal to 0 and 1 in the tested bit stream.</li>\n",
    "        <li><i>Poker test</i> -- tests the probabilities of 16 possible values of groups of four bits.</li>\n",
    "        <li><i>Runs test</i> -- tests the probabilities of runs of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6+ identical values.</li>\n",
    "        <li><i>Long runs test</i> -- searches for runs  of  length  34  or  more  (of  either  zeros  or  ones).</li>\n",

    "        <li>The fisrt type of error occurs when the generator functions correctly (it behaves as an ideal RNG, i.e. the null hypothesis is true), but the test rejects the null hypothesis. \n",
    "    This type of error, which is called Type 1 error or false reject, is less security critical. It appears with probability $\\alpha$.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "        <li>The second type of error occurs when the null hypothesis is false (the generator is imperfect), but the test does not reject the null hypothesis. This kind of error, which is more dangerous, is called Type 2  error or false accept.\n",
    "It appears with probability $\\beta$. Unfortunately, although more security critical, $\\beta$ is more difficult to assess than $\\alpha$.</li>    \n",

    "    When applied on a sequence of $Number\\ of\\ input\\ bits$ random bits, the test rise an alarm if the number of 1 is bigger than $\\frac{Number\\ of\\ input\\ bits}{2}+relative\\ threshold$ or is smaller than $\\frac{Number\\ of\\ input\\ bits}{2}-relative\\ threshold$.\n",

The left plot is a zoom the case where the RNG entropy is equal to 1.00 per bit which correspond to an ideal RNG (i.e. Null hypothesis is true). The right plot is a zoom the case where the RNG entropy is equal a chosen value corresponding to a non-ideal RNG (i.e. Null hypothesis is false).\n",

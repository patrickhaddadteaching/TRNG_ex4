* With which propbability the monobit test classified the RNG as a non-ideal one whereas it is ideal ?
  - for Number of input bits  is 4096  : 1.079E-06  
  - for Number of input bits  is 8192  : 1.038E-06
  - for Number of input bits  is 16384 : 1.003E-06  
  - for Number of input bits  is 32768 : 1.041E-06  
*What is the entropy limit above which the monobit test will always correctly classified the RNG as a non-ideal ?
  - for Number of input bits  is 4096  : 0.983
  - for Number of input bits  is 8192  : 0.992  
  - for Number of input bits  is 16384 : 0.996  
  - for Number of input bits  is 32768 : 0.998
